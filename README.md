#Garbage Monitoring
This is my final project for University. I use Python, Django and MongoDB for this project. This project connected to raspberryPi with django server. 
This project's data storaged on MongoDB.
I use different Python library for this project. Like; RPi.GPIO , Numpy , Pandas and Matplotlib.
That's project's main idea is solve some governments environment problems.
This system to be able to view garbabes storage after that you can empty that's garbage.
In this project, it is aimed to display the occupancy rates in the garbage and make it easier to make managerial decisions based on these rates.
Data is received using some sensors and can be viewed on the internet via the django server.
Thanks to Python libraries and raspberry pi device, this data is turned into input.
It is aimed to reduce manpower and workload and to make a decision-making system at the same time
